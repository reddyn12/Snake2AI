# GOAL: Encode ALL of the nake game into a neural netowrk
## STEPS:
1. given board, path, action, possible rand val - updata board properly
2. Gen possible rand vals?
3. given board init - update board properly at every time step
4. given board, path - draw game

# Using this knowledge, going to see if more complex games can be encoded into executable weights - BOTH logic and grphics
